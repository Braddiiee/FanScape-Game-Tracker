## API Endpoints 🔗

### User Authentication

* **POST /register:** Register a new user
* **POST /login:** Login existing user
* **POST /logout:** Logout current user

### User Data

* **POST /profile:** View user dashboard (requires login)

### Game and Team Management

* Users can save games and teams (API routes to be implemented)
* Fetch saved games/teams for each user

---

## Security Considerations 🔒

* Passwords are hashed using **Bcrypt** before storing in the database.
* Sessions are stored server-side using **Flask-Session**.
* Sensitive routes are protected by session checks.
* Always validate input from users to prevent injection attacks.

---

## Future Improvements 🌱

* Implement **JWT authentication** for API access.
* Add routes for saving/fetching games and teams dynamically.
* Integrate **live sports API** for real-time updates.
* Enhance front-end dashboard with **React** or modern JS frameworks.
* Add **search and filtering** for sports, competitions, games, and teams.
